\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Rhothvo{\ss} showed that the matching polytope has extension complexity $2^{\Omega(n)}$
\item<2-> In this work, he also showed that the extension complexity of $\TSP(n)$ is $2^{\Omega(n)}$.
\item<3-> Braverman and Moitra showed that any linear program that attains an $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ approximation for Max-Clique has size $2^{\Omega(n^\epsilon)}$.
